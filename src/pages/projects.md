# Projects

Over the years I have had the good fortune to work on some pretty interesting stuff. Here's a few of my recent projects.

## Portfolio Transformer

We implemented a Time2Vec + Transformer forecasting model to generate FX hedge strategies

## Knot Recognition (CNN/ViT)

We built Vanilla, CNN, and ViT pipelines to count knot crossings

## Car Consumption and Taxation

We experimented on IRS + household survey data to measure behavioral response to tax regimes and recommend policy changes
