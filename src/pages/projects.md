# Projects

Over the years, I've had the good fortune to collaborate on a range of projects. Here are a few highlights:

## Portfolio Transformer

We implemented a Time2Vec + Transformer forecasting model to generate FX hedge strategies

## Knot Recognition (CNN/ViT)

We built Vanilla, CNN, and ViT pipelines to count knot crossings

## Car Consumption and Taxation

We integrated Tax Foundation and National Household Travel Survey data, modeling behavioral responses to varying gas tax regimes (controlling for income tax) and recommending policy changes
