# Hi, I’m Anne 🕵🏻‍♀️

This is my site's dev branch!

I am an experienced data scientist and research mathematician fascinated by the challenge of shaping messy data into coherent stories and useful tools.

With a background in representation theory (pattern recognition), I enjoy collaborating end-to-end on multi-layered and complex problems.
