# Hi, I’m Anne 🕵🏻‍♀️

I am an experienced data scientist and research mathematician fascinated with SNR. In other words, I reshape data putty into coherent stories and useful tools.

With a background in <span class="swap"><span class="front">representation theory</span><span class="back">_pattern recognition</span></span>, I enjoy collaborating end-to-end on multi-layered and complex problems.
