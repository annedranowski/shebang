# Hi, I’m Anne 🕵🏻‍♀️

I am fascinated with pattern recognition. As a quantitative & qualitative researcher, I curate and reshape data to inform effective decision-making and drive growth. 

With a background in representation theory, I enjoy collaborating end-to-end on multi-layered functional & dynamic solutions.
